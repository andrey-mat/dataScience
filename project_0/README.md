### Project description
Guess the number guessed by computer for minimal number of attempts<br>

### Case study
We need to create a computer programm which will guess the number for minimal number of attempts.<br>

**Competition rules:**
- Computer guesses int number in range 0 - 100 and we need to figure out what the number is. "Figure out" means that we need to create a computer programm which will guess the number for minimal number of attempts.
- Algorithm considers the information if random number larger or smaller that the one we are looking for

**Quality metrics**

Results to be evaluated by average number of guess attempts for 1000 iterations

**What do we practice?**

- Learning how to create good python code
- Git implementation
- Learning how to use VS code
- Learning Jupiter notebook

### Data brief information<br>
Data is gathering using *random* functions to the list with 1000 positions<br>

### Project stages<br>
Ver. 1 - Program requests user to make guessing<br>
Ver. 2 - Program uses *random* method to guess<br>
Ver. 3 - Program uses *smart* method to guess<br>

### Results<br>
Algorith to guess the number with average number of attempts less than 20 was found<br>

### Conclusions<br>
Obviously, smart way of doing things is always quite better then just picking up the random numbers<br>
